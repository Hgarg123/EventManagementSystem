                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Elevated Event Management Ltd is an event logistics and marketing company which was
                        formed
                        back
                        in 2013. The
                        company offers A-Z event planning services from a team of experienced and energetic
                        event
                        planners, suppliers, venues and more. One of the main reasons behind the success of this
                        company
                        is the fact that the team does not charge fees to its clients! With the number of events
                        we organise, Event Planner Ltd does not need to add exorbitant fees and mark-ups to make
                        its
                        profit margins. This ensures that our clients list, which is constantly growing, make
                        regular
                        use of our services.</p>
